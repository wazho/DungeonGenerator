### Upload your code via Git

Keep the `master` branch is stable version. Any unstable work don't commit on `master`, checkout to another branch is better way. Merge it until your branch is finish without obvious bugs.

We already set the [.gitignore](https://github.com/grass0916/DungeonGenerator/blob/master/.gitignore), you don't need remove the `*.meta` files each time.
